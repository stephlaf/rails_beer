# Personal project having to do with üçª

### With hundreds of microbrewery beers in Quebec, it's hard for me to keep track of what I tried.

This project is a tool to keep track in an easy way of the beers I've tried, to rate them and take some notes along the way.

The barcode scanner functionality does not work at the moment for my key has expired. I intend to either turn this into an API and have the UI done in Swift ot Turbo Native.

You can find the live app [here](https://hopscan.herokuapp.com/)
